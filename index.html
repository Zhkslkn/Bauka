                <div class="content3-text">

                    <span></span> Today, artificial intelligence (AI) is considered one of the most promising areas of development not only in the IT industry, but also in many other areas of human activity. In particular, solutions based on artificial intelligence are one of the main hopes in terms of implementing the concept of “Digital Economy”. <br>
                    <span></span> Previously, medicine was mainly focused on acute diseases, but today the main focus is the treatment of chronic diseases, such as obesity, depression, diabetes. Diagnosing the early stages of heart failure, cancer and other diseases saves the lives of many patients, but for doctors this task is the most difficult. Even recognized luminaries of medical science, who have great professional experience and intuition, it is not easy to find the right solution when the amount of information in the field of medicine is increasing every day. Therefore, in order to quickly solve problems, doctors need to apply, in addition to their personal intelligence, also artificial intelligence. <br>
                    <span></span> Relevance: The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in medicine is one of the most important modern trends in world health care. Artificial intelligence technologies are fundamentally changing the world's health care system, making it possible to fundamentally redesign medical diagnostics, develop new drugs, and generally improve the quality of health care services while reducing costs for medical clinics. <br>
                    <span></span> It has recently been found that a physician's brain can use only 10% of the world's medical knowledge. And artificial intelligence (AI) is guided for medical diagnosis and treatment by all 100% of the information available on the Web. Artificial Intelligence is capable of processing thousands of pages of text per second to find the information needed, something no doctor can do. Approximately every 20 minutes, a new medical article appears worldwide; in 2019 alone, 70,000 scientific medical articles were published. <br>
                    <span></span> On average, doctors make treatment errors 10% of the time. And the discrepancy between postmortem and lifetime diagnoses is 20-25%. This suggests that a quarter of deaths are due to a disease that was not detected in life.

                <div class="content4-text-title">2.1 Artificial Intelligence in Medicine</div>
                
                <div class="content4-text">

                    <div class="content-first-column">

                        <span></span> Artificial intelligence began its renaissance with the advent of the first electronic computing machines in the 1940s. With the advent of computers, the prerequisites for the possibility of artificial intelligence began to emerge. Questions arose as to whether it was possible to create a machine that would have the same intellectual capabilities as (or far surpass) humans. Scientists in the 1950s conducted experiments to create equipment that would mimic the human brain. Such attempts were unsuccessful because there was a complete unsuitability of the software and hardware. <br>
                        <span></span> In 1956, a workshop was held on developing logic problems and ways to automate their solution. This was the first time the term "artificial intelligence" was introduced. After the seminar, artificial intelligence was recognized as a separate branch of science. Twenty-five years later, Barr and Feigenbaum offer a more precise definition of artificial intelligence, stating that artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that deals with the development of intelligent computer systems: language understanding, learning, reasoning ability, problem solving, etc. <br>
                        <span></span> From the beginning, the artificial intelligence industry has been divided into 2 parts: <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1. Cybernetics</li>
                            <li>2. Neurocybernetics.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <span></span> The basic idea of neurocybernetics is to confirm the uniqueness of the human brain, which can think. Consequently, an artificial intelligence device should be similar to the brain. Neurocybernetics has begun to explore in detail the hardware modeling of structures similar to the structure of the human brain. They set to work on creating and eating a system of elements that resembled neurons. Such systems came to be called neural networks. <br>
                        <span></span> Cybernetics took the side of rejecting the idea of completely replicating human thought processes. For them, it didn't matter how the "thinking" device worked. What mattered was that the device and the human answer the same questions. Cyberneticists were not interested in how things worked inside the machine. This is why they got the name "black box" cybernetics. <br>
                        <span></span> Developers from various companies (Microsoft, Apple, Google, etc.) are working to create products using artificial intelligence for the healthcare industry. Artificial intelligence is currently being used in drug development, medical imaging, genome research and disease diagnosis. The devices created can be trained. They can also independently analyze vast amounts of information received, draw conclusions, and make decisions, saving time, money, and maximizing effect in patient care. <br>

                        <span></span> In order to correctly identify the cause of disease and provide competent treatment, it is necessary to study patient data: look at medical history, tests, photos, etc. Sometimes the most experienced doctors can't make a confident diagnosis because they can't see the full picture of the disease. According to Google analytics, one in 10 patients suffers from a misdiagnosis. Many have resorted to the theory that artificial intelligence could help solve this problem. Some hospitals in the U.K. are already using Deepmind Health's development. It processes all the information about the patient, all his symptoms, and gives a list of recommendations to the attending physician, who ends up making an accurate, definitive diagnosis. <br>
                        
                    </div>


                    <div class="content-second-column">

                        <span></span> There are systems that can give their results directly to the patient rather than to the doctor. One such system is Ada. It advises the patient, gives advice, suggests which doctor to go to, and offers a remote consultation with a specialist. <br>
                        
                        <span></span> Sensely was invented for people who have recently undergone a long period of treatment or have chronic diseases. The system gives alerts about the time of taking medication, the need for monitoring by a doctor, structures data about the patient's condition and sends statistics to the treating doctor. <br>
                        <span></span> At the moment, there are genetic analysis systems that identify a patient's propensity for various diseases, help understand the root cause of the disease, and indicate what effect can be expected from a particular drug. <br>
                        <span></span> Scientists have learned how to use artificial intelligence to create drugs. Finding the right chemical formula for them takes a long time. As a result, the desired result is not always obtained. Even a lot of tests, screenings and analyses are not always able to give a one hundred percent guarantee that the medicine will work. That is why artificial intelligence is used for help, which in turn creates the correct chemical formulas for drugs. <br>
                        <span></span> Sometimes cancer patients are left with only one last hope for a cure. The IBM Watson supercomputer was created in 2011. For now, its Watson for Oncology module is applicable to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. <br>
                        <span></span> The main mission of the supercomputer is to find the necessary information in the database and provide it to the user. In the case of Watson for Oncology, this database includes more than 600 thousand medical reports and diagnoses, as well as two million pages of texts from medical journals and clinical trials in the field of oncology. <br>
                        <span></span> The neural network can suggest several treatment options; the doctor will have to choose the best one. The doctor can add information about the patient as needed, and the computer at that point will search for a new course of treatment according to the information entered and provide an updated diagnosis after a short period of time. <br>
                        <span></span> In 2016, AI identified a rare form of leukemia in a 60-year-old patient who was initially misdiagnosed. To do so, the system studied 20 million scientific articles about cancer in ten minutes. <br>
                        <span></span> One well-established type of artificial intelligence in medicine is QTrobot: a robot for the therapy of children with autism spectrum disorders. Such patients have difficulty communicating with others: they barely perceive other people's emotions and have difficulty expressing their own. The older the person gets, the more difficult it becomes, because the problem gets worse. Therefore, if you do not pay proper attention to this disorder at an early age, it will be difficult to cope with it later. <br>
                        <span></span> The use of artificial intelligence in medicine will help make disease diagnosis more accurate, allowing for effective prognosis and disease prevention. AI will help save more sick patients, increase the efficiency of medical institutions, and make doctors' work easier.

                    <div class="content-first-column">

                        <span></span> Artificial intelligence in medicine is the use of machine learning models to search medical data and uncover insights to help improve health outcomes and patient experiences. Thanks to recent advances in computer science and informatics, artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly becoming an integral part of modern healthcare. AI algorithms and other applications powered by AI are being used to support medical professionals in clinical settings and in ongoing research. <br>
                        <span></span> Currently, the most common roles for AI in medical settings are clinical decision support and imaging analysis. Clinical decision support tools help providers make decisions about treatments, medications, mental health and other patient needs by providing them with quick access to information or research that's relevant to their patient. In medical imaging, AI tools are being used to analyze CT scans, x-rays, MRIs and other images for lesions or other findings that a human radiologist might miss. <br>
                        <span></span> The challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic created for many health systems also led many healthcare organizations around the world to start field-testing new AI-supported technologies, such as algorithms designed to help monitor patients and AI-powered tools to screen COVID-19 patients. <br>
                        <span></span> The research and results of these tests are still being gathered, and the overall standards for the use AI in medicine are still being defined. Yet opportunities for AI to benefit clinicians, researchers and the patients they serve are steadily increasing. At this point, there is little doubt that AI will become a core part of the digital health systems that shape and support modern medicine.

                <div class="content6-text-title">2.3 Benefits of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine</div>
                
                <div class="content6-text">

                    <span></span> Tools equipped with artificial intelligence can extract meaningful information from large amounts of data, offering practically applicable ideas that can benefit a variety of fields. <br>
                    <span></span> Artificial intelligence, according to experts, is the phenomenon where an inanimate system (machine) imitates the actions of a human with rational behavior. The machine must accept changing information data and produce the right decision. Since the beginning of our century there are mainly two types of artificial intelligence used for medical purposes: <br>
                    <span></span><span></span> 1. Expert systems.  <br>
                    <span></span><span></span> 2. Neural networks. <br>
                    <span></span> Facts in the knowledge base of an expert system are reliable data in a selected area. For example: "Healthy people have two hands". While working the system receives information about a pressing problem: "Patient X has one arm". This information is written to the working memory. The working memory, after accessing the database and comparing the information, forms a conclusion: "Patient X is not healthy". But implementation of expert systems is a very costly procedure that requires a lot of resources. To design a good expert system, experts in medicine, specialists in scientific knowledge, software engineers are required. <br>
                    <span></span> Informed patient care <br>
                    <span></span> Integrating medical AI into clinician workflows can give providers valuable context while they're making care decisions. A trained machine learning algorithm can help cut down on research time by giving clinicians valuable search results with evidence-based insights about treatments and procedures while the patient is still in the room with them. <br>
                    <span></span> Error reduction <br>
                    <span></span> There is some evidence that AI can help improve patient safety. A recent systemic reviewof 53 peer-reviewed studies examining the impact of AI on patient safety found that AI-powered decision support tools can help improve error detection and drug management. <br>
                    <span></span> Reducing the costs of care <br>
                    <span></span> There are a lot of potential ways AI could reduce costs across the healthcare industry. Some of the most promising opportunities include reducing medication errors, customized virtual health assistance, fraud prevention, and supporting more efficient administrative and clinical workflows. <br>
                    <span></span> Increasing doctor-patient engagement <br>
                    <span></span> Many patients think of questions outside of typical business hours. AI can help provide around-the-clock support through chatbots that can answer basic questions and give patients resources when their provider’s office isn’t open. AI could also potentially be used to triage questions and flag information for further review, which could help alert providers to health changes that need additional attention. <br>
                    <span></span> Providing contextual relevance <br>
                    <span></span> One major advantage of deep learning is that AI algorithms can use context to distinguish between different types of information. For example, if a clinical note includes a list of a patient's current medications along with a new medication their provider recommends, a well-trained AI algorithm can use natural language processing to identify which medications belong in the patient's medical history.

                <div class="content6-text-title">2.4 The difference between artificial intelligence and conventional computer programs</div>
                
                <div class="content6-text">

                    <span></span> They are two parallel research efforts working on similar problems, but with different methodologies and histories. Essentially, they study similar things, but with different tools. In the modern context, computational intelligence tends to use bio-inspired computing, like evolutionary and genetic algorithms. AI tends to prefer techniques with stronger theoretical guarantees, and still has a significant community focused on purely deductive reasoning. The main area of overlap is in machine learning, especially neural networks. <br>
                    <span></span> The longer answer is that your source from 1948 says they are synonyms in part because it predates the split in the research community, which took place later. <br>
                    <span></span> The two communities have always some overlap in topics, but in my experience, mostly are skeptical of each other's methodologies, and mostly publish in separate journals. Some authors consider CI to be a subset of AI however, particularly those writing in the 1990s. <br>
                    <span></span> Example topics that are solidly in AI but definitely not in CI are logical and expert systems, and statistical approaches to machine learning like regression. <br>
                    <span></span> Example topics that are solidly in CI but perhaps not in AI (depending on whether one views CI as a subset of AI or not) are genetic programming, fuzzy logic, and ant colony optimization. <br>
                    <span></span> As a rule, AI-rooted techniques have better theoretical guarantees, and better developed theory in general (there are exceptions though). For example, Fuzzy Logic has been strongly criticized for the lack of a solid theoretical foundation (good modern summary here), as have genetic and evolutionary approaches (most famously, both lack a proof of convergence within finite time to a global optimum on a smooth surface, even though they do quite well in practice). <br>
                    <span></span> CI-rooted techniques nonetheless often see major performance advantages in specific problems (see, for instance, deep learning results), and tend to have a strong experimental and engineering tradition. The No Free Lunch theorems are often used to justify their use when theoretical certainty is missing. Basically, the theorems say that, in learning and optimization problems, a technique can only perform well on a problem by performing poorly on some other problem. CI authors argue that there are some problem domains in which their techniques work well (which must be true, because simpler algorithms like hill-climbing outperform them on simple problems). <br>

                <div class="content5-text">

                    <div class="content-first-column">

                        <span></span> There are numerous ways AI can positively impact the practice of medicine, whether it's through speeding up the pace of research or helping clinicians make better decisions. Here are some examples of how AI could be used: <br>
                        ❖	AI in disease detection and diagnosis <br>
                        <span></span> Unlike humans, AI never needs to sleep. Machine learning models could be used to observe the vital signs of patients receiving critical care and alert clinicians if certain risk factors increase. While medical devices like heart monitors can track vital signs, AI can collect the data from those devices and look for more complex conditions, such as sepsis. One IBM client has developed a predictive AI model for premature babies that is 75% accurate in detecting severe sepsis. <br>
                        ❖	Personalized disease treatment <br>
                        <span></span> Precision medicine could become easier to support with virtual AI assistance. Because AI models can learn and retain preferences, AI has the potential to provide customized real-time recommendations to patients around the clock. Rather than having to repeat information with a new person each time, a healthcare system could offer patients around-the-clock access to an AI-powered virtual assistant that could answer questions based on the patient's medical history, preferences and personal needs. <br>
                        ❖	AI in medical imaging <br>
                        <span></span> AI is already playing a prominent role in medical imaging. Research has indicated that AI powered by artificial neural networks can be just as effective as human radiologists at detecting signs of breast cancer as well as other conditions. In addition to helping clinicians spot early signs of disease, AI can also help make the staggering number of medical images that clinicians have to keep track of more manageable by detecting vital pieces of a patient's history and presenting the relevant images to them. <br>
                        ❖	Clinical trial efficiency <br>
                        <span></span> A lot of time is spent during clinical trials assigning medical codes to patient outcomes and updating the relevant datasets. AI can help speed this process up by providing a quicker and more intelligent search for medical codes. They could reduce their number of medical code searches by more than 70%.

                        <span></span> Decreasing Healthcare Costs to Get Financial Profit                           
                        <span></span> Artificial Intelligence can help you in numerous ways that can reduce the overall costs. With the help of advancement in artificial intelligence, the healthcare sector offers numerous treatment options that give high accuracy and insight of diseases. With the correct identification of diseases, results lead to effective treatment and prevent hospital readmissions. <br>
                        Prevent Human Errors <br>                                                                                     
                        <span></span> It has been observed many times that either the experts tend to prescribe a wrong medicine or mistakenly deliver another medicine. In particular, such mistakes can be reduced through usage of artificial intelligence providing high-quality services due to the advent of technology; it improves the treatment plans and other monitoring treatments. With the help of great instruments, doctors are able to take care of patients more accurately. <br>
                        High Tech Devices                    <br>             
                        <span></span> Lifestyle ailments can be anticipated through hereditary plans from last few years. By deciding the tests and medications required for every patient, AI will additionally customise medication. Early treatment can diminish the expense of wellbeing and dispose of the risk of chronic illnesses. <br>
                        Artificial intelligence can rapidly and all the more precisely recognise indications of illness in clinical pictures, similar to MRI, CT outputs, ultrasound and x-beams, and in this way permits quicker diagnostics decreasing the time patients hang tight for a determination from weeks to minor hours and quickening the presentation of treatment options. <br>
                        Virtual Assistant <br>
                        <span></span> Right now is an age when individuals hope to find solutions in a flash, AI virtual assistants help patients to find solutions progressively. Patients can pose clinical inquiries and get answers, get more data and updates about taking prescriptions, report data to doctors, and addition other clinical help. Doctors can likewise exploit social insurance virtual assistants by following and finishing requests and ensuring they are requesting the right drug for patients.  <br>
                        Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare Industry  <br>
                        Exactness and Safety of the Patient                             <br>                                       
                        <span></span> To  keep delicate information, for example, addresses and money related and wellbeing data safe, AI must be dependable enough.  <br>

                        <span></span> Numerous guidelines protect the information of the patient and don’t unveil the personality of the patient that makes it difficult to dissect information. Despite what might be expected, as a result of market rivalry, in some cases, medicinal services organisations are themselves reluctant to share data. Numerous specialists don’t need their adversaries to see absolutely what number of tasks they have led and where. Likewise, medical clinic socioeconomics gives a monetary advantage over another emergency clinic.  <br>
                        Adjust Technologies    <br>                                                                                   <span></span> One of the difficulties AI faces in medicinal services is boundless clinical appropriation. To understand the estimation of AI, the social insurance industry needs to make a workforce that is proficient about AI so they can utilise AI advances accordingly empowering or they need some knowledgeable person to utilise it correctly. <br>
                        Risker <br>
                        <span></span> AI can likewise represent riskier for specialists and patients. Since AI has not been idealised, specialists can’t completely depend on AI and still need to settle on choices dependent on their insight and skill. Patients are likewise in danger for a similar explanation. In the event that a program gives off base data, patients won’t be dealt with appropriately.  <br>
                        Hazard in new/extraordinary wellbeing cases  <br>                                                 
                        <span></span> In addition to the fact that AI has to be precise and safe, it must be made so it is fully informed regarding new wellbeing cases. With new tools and innovation, there is always patient health on the stack which gives users the projects needed to be prepared and what options are required during wellbeing cases.  <br>
                        All in All <br>
                        <span></span> The pace of technology is getting faster these days, and most organisations are ready to accept these innovations to the core. Changes are always required for the origin that helps most sectors to scale up. Artificial intelligence services in the healthcare industry these days are getting a humongous response in almost every sector, especially healthcare. But as we all are aware that everything has two sides, positive and negative, so does artificial intelligence services.

                <div class="content3-text">

                    To summarize, we believe that in the near future the following innovative processes will be applied to healthcare with the help of artificial intelligence. <br>
                    <span></span> 1. Automated diagnostic methods, for example, analysis of X-ray or MRI-images for automatic detection of pathology, microscopic analysis of biological material, automatic coding of ECG, electroencephalograms, etc. Storing a large number of decoded results of diagnostic examination in electronic form, when there is not only the data itself, but also a formalized conclusion on them, allows creating really reliable and valuable software products, which can if not replace a doctor, then provide him effective help, for example, in detecting routine pathology, reducing the time and cost of examination, introduction of outsourcing and remote diagnostics. <br>
                    <span></span> 2. Speech recognition and natural language understanding systems they can be of significant help to both the clinician and the patient. From basic speech decoding and turning it into text as a more advanced interface for communicating with medical information systems (MIS), calling a call centre or voice assistant, to ideas such as automatic language translation when receiving a foreigner, speech synthesis when reading records from an MIS, a robotic receptionist in a hospital emergency room or clinic receptionist capable of answering simple questions and referring patients, etc. <br>
                    <span></span> 3. Event analysis and prediction systems are also quite solvable artificial intelligence tasks right now, and they can have a significant effect. For example, rapid analysis of changes in morbidity can quickly predict changes in patient access to health care providers or medication needs.
                    This development of health care toward self-care and greater involvement of patients in their own health care without seeing a doctor could save significant financial resources.
                    <span></span>Of course, when it comes to human health, the principle of "do no harm" is important, the implementation of which implies a strict regulatory framework and a thorough evidence base for the introduction of new technologies.  <br>
